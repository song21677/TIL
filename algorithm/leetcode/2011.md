# Final Value of Variable After Performing Operations

## Problem
There is a programming language with only four operations and one variable X:

++X and X++ increments the value of the variable X by 1.
--X and X-- decrements the value of the variable X by 1.
Initially, the value of X is 0.

Given an array of strings operations containing a list of operations, return the final value of X after performing all the operations.
<br><br>

## Example
```
Input: operations = ["++X","++X","X++"]
Output: 3
Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
Initially, X = 0.
++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 0 + 1 = 1.
++X: X is incremented by 1, X = 1 + 1 = 2.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X = 2 + 1 = 3.
```

## My Solution

```java
// TC: O(n^2)

class Solution {
    public int finalValueAfterOperations(String[] operations) {
        int X = 0;

        for (String operation : operations) {
            if (operation.equals("++X") || operation.equals("X++"))
                X += 1;
            else if (operation.equals("--X") || operation.equals("X--"))
                X -= 1;
        }

        return X;
    }
}
```

## Other peopleâ€™s Solution

```java
// TC: O(n), SC: O(1)

class Solution {
    public int finalValueAfterOperations(String[] operations) {
        int x = 0;
        for (String s : operations) {
            // the character at the index 1 would always be either - or +
            x += (s.charAt(1) == '+')? 1 : -1;
        }

        return x;
    }
}
