# Baseball Game

## Problem
You are keeping the scores for a baseball game with strange rules. At the beginning of the game, you start with an empty record.

You are given a list of strings `operations`, where `operations[i]` is the `ith` operation you must apply to the record and is one of the following:

- An integer `x`.
    - Record a new score of `x`.
- `'+'`.
    - Record a new score that is the sum of the previous two scores.
- `'D'`.
    - Record a new score that is the double of the previous score.
- `'C'`.
    - Invalidate the previous score, removing it from the record.

Return *the sum of all the scores on the record after applying all the operations*.

The test cases are generated such that the answer and all intermediate calculations fit in a **32-bit** integer and that all operations are valid.

## Example
```java
Input: ops = ["5","2","C","D","+"]
Output: 30
Explanation:
"5" - Add 5 to the record, record is now [5].
"2" - Add 2 to the record, record is now [5, 2].
"C" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [5].
"D" - Add 2 * 5 = 10 to the record, record is now [5, 10].
"+" - Add 5 + 10 = 15 to the record, record is now [5, 10, 15].
The total sum is 5 + 10 + 15 = 30.
```
```java
Input: ops = ["5","-2","4","C","D","9","+","+"]
Output: 27
Explanation:
"5" - Add 5 to the record, record is now [5].
"-2" - Add -2 to the record, record is now [5, -2].
"4" - Add 4 to the record, record is now [5, -2, 4].
"C" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [5, -2].
"D" - Add 2 * -2 = -4 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4].
"9" - Add 9 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4, 9].
"+" - Add -4 + 9 = 5 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4, 9, 5].
"+" - Add 9 + 5 = 14 to the record, record is now [5, -2, -4, 9, 5, 14].
The total sum is 5 + -2 + -4 + 9 + 5 + 14 = 27.
```
```java
Input: ops = ["1","C"]
Output: 0
Explanation:
"1" - Add 1 to the record, record is now [1].
"C" - Invalidate and remove the previous score, record is now [].
Since the record is empty, the total sum is 0.

## My Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int calPoints(String[] operations) {
        Stack<Integer> s = new Stack<Integer>();

        for (String op : operations) {
            switch (op) {
                case "C" :
                    s.pop();
                    break;
                case "D" :
                    s.push(s.peek()*2);
                    break;
                case "+" :
                    int top = s.pop();       
                    int tmp = top + s.peek();
                    s.push(top);
                    s.push(tmp);    
                    break;
                default :
                    s.push(Integer.valueOf(op));
                }
            }

        int sum = 0;

        for (int e : s)
            sum += e;

        return sum;

        }
    }
```

        for(String op : ops) {
            if (op.equals("+")) {
                int top = stack.pop();
                int newtop = top + stack.peek();
                stack.push(top);

                stack.push(Integer.valueOf(op));
            }
        }

        int ans = 0;
        for(int score : stack) ans += score;
        return ans;
    }
}
