# Count of Matches in Tournament

## Problem
You are given an integer n, the number of teams in a tournament that has strange rules:

If the current number of teams is even, each team gets paired with another team. A total of n / 2 matches are played, and n / 2 teams advance to the next round.
If the current number of teams is odd, one team randomly advances in the tournament, and the rest gets paired. A total of (n - 1) / 2 matches are played, and (n - 1) / 2 + 1 teams advance to the next round.
Return the number of matches played in the tournament until a winner is decided.
<br><br>

## Example
```
Input: n = 7
Output: 6
Explanation: Details of the tournament: 
- 1st Round: Teams = 7, Matches = 3, and 4 teams advance.
- 2nd Round: Teams = 4, Matches = 2, and 2 teams advance.
- 3rd Round: Teams = 2, Matches = 1, and 1 team is declared the winner.
Total number of matches = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6.
```

## My Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public int numberOfMatches(int n) {
        int total = 0, matches, advance=n;

        while (true) {
            if (advance == 1) break;

            if (advance % 2 == 1) {
                matches = (advance-1)/2;
                total += matches;
                advance = matches + 1;
            }
            else {
                matches = advance/2;
                total += matches;
                advance = matches;
            }
        } 
        return total;
    }
}
```

- Creating a Recursive Solution
```java
class Solution {
	public int numberOfMatches(int n) {
		// This is the problem's base case; we know that if n == 1,
		// the number of matches played must be 0, since the last team left
		// can't play a match against themselves.
		if (n == 1) return 0;

		// We declare an int to hold our recursive solution.
		int res;

		// We initialize res using a recursive call, reducing n 
		// as described in the problem.
		if (n % 2 == 0) {
			res = numberOfMatches(n / 2);
			// After the recursive call is executed, we add the appropriate value to
			// our solution variable.
			res += n / 2;
		}
		else {
			res = numberOfMatches((n - 1) / 2 + 1);
			res += (n - 1) / 2;
		}

		// Our initial call to numberOfMatches()
		// will return the total number of matches
		// added to res in each recursive call.
		return res;
	}
}
```
```java
class Solution {
	public int numberOfMatches(int n) {
		if (n==1) return 0;
		numberOfMatches(n/2 + n%2) + n/2;
	}
}
```

* Simplifying with the Ternary Operator
```java
class Solution {
	public int numberOfMatches(int n) {
		if (n == 1) return 0;
		return n % 2 == 0 ? numberOfMatches(n/2) + n/2 : numberOfMatches((n-1)/2+1) + (n-1)/2;
	}
}
```

* O(1) Solution
```java
// n teams, one match, one lose and eiminated.
// The champion never lose, n-1 other team lose.
// So need n-1 match.

class Solution {
	public int numberOfMatches(int n) {
		return n-1;.
	}
}
